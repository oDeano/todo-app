#Current state
In the middle of implementing a class (rDate) to convert the date into more useable formats.
JS doesn't have private methods for some reason which is an annoyance.
Can't create instanced variables that can be used throughout the class - May have to create separate functions for returning year/month/day strings.

Need to add "project" categories, possibly with child sub-projects.
Need to create the sidebar NAV, which would show various categories of tasks (all/projects/filter).
On the "all" category, add filters for things like "next 7/14/30 days".
Add prioritites.
